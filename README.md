## Project Overview
This project implements a Recommendation System and Rating Predictor using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, designed to suggest items to users based on their preferences and historical data. It is particularly aimed at applications in e-commerce, movie streaming platforms, and any service where personalized content recommendation can enhance user experience.

### Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests items based on movie's relatedness with each other.
- **Rating Prediction:** Predicts how a user might rate an item they haven't interacted with yet.
- **Dynamic Learning:** Updates recommendations as it learns more about user preferences.
